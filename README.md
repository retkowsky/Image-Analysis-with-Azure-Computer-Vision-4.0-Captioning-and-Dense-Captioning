# Image Analysis with Azure Computer Vision 4.0 Captioning and Dense Captioning

"Caption" replaces "Describe" in V4.0 as the significantly improved image captioning feature rich with details and sematic understanding. 

- Dense Captions provides more detail by generating one sentence descriptions of up to 10 regions of the image in addition to describing the whole image. 
- Dense Captions also returns bounding box coordinates of the described image regions. 
- There's also a new gender-neutral parameter to allow customers to choose whether to enable probabilistic gender inference for alt-text and Seeing AI applications. 
- Automatically deliver rich captions, accessible alt-text, SEO optimization, and intelligent photo curation to support digital content.

This service is currently in preview, and the API may change in the future.
